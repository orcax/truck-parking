      <p>The truck parking research in the Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation (CAIT) at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, was conducted under the research project CAIT-UTC-NC15 Development of a Methodological Framework for Optimal Truck Highway Parking Location and Capacity Expansion. It was sponsored by U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) through University Transportation Center (UTC) grant. This research aims to synthesize and integrate the prior related work into a semi-quantitative methodology framework for comprehensive evaluation of potential truck parking locations. It can potentially assist state and regional agencies in making better-informed decisions to optimally allocate limited public resources. The methodology can be further improved by applying the state-of-art benefit-cost analysis (BCA) approaches and possibly being integrated with intelligent parking management systems for long-term network performance enhancement.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CAIT</span> based at Rutgers University, is one of only 5 National University Transportation Centers (UTC), a group of academic research institutions sanctioned and supported by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Its research, education, and technology transfer initiatives address critical multimodal transportation issues such as mobility, congestion, bridge and road health monitoring and rehabilitation, asset management, etc. Located in central New Jersey, CAIT is in the most densely populated transportation corridor in the United States. Taking advantage of its proximity to the most heavily traveled roadway network, third largest port system, busiest rail line, and four major international airports, CAIT researchers use the area as an in situ laboratory and test bed for real-world solutions.</p>
