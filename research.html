            <p>The research results include a BCA based methodology framework for comprehensive evaluation of developing or expanding a truck stop, which could be useful for the planning process and investment decision making for both public agencies (e.g., MPOs) and private industries.  An illustrative case study was conducted to provide application insights.</p>
            <p>We also conducted comprehensive spatial analysis of the freight trends in the State of New Jersey and county-level analyses of land use possibilities across the state.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <p>The methodological framework attempts to quantify economic, fiscal, environmental and safety costs and benefits associated with locating a truck stop.  Modeling and analytical approaches of individual benefit-cost items are proposed and/or integrated from existing literature.  Individual analyses of future research into these topics are discussed, with the ultimate goal of applying the proposed methodological framework to develop comprehensive cost-benefit analyses.</p>

          <p>Population density and current freight trends particularly conducive to truck traffic generation are examined in New Jersey, using ArcGIS spatial tools.</p>
          <p>A significant portion of the analysis is also based on insightful information from meetings with representatives from, NJMTA, NATSO, DVRPC and NJTPA. A county-by-county analysis combining both qualitative and quantitative characteristics is provided. These analyses are used to identify those key sites to which the cost-benefit methodology may be applied to.</p>
          <p>Truck parking inventory assessment helps us to compare existing and projected supply and demand along the major corridor in New Jersey.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>The methodology is used to evaluate a 44.9-acre parcel in Newark, NJ identified by the NJTPA as a site of interest for a new truck stop.  A 30,000 square foot facility is also proposed, which would include a convenience store, multiple meal options, and maintenance facility, in addition to a fueling station.</p>
          <p>The analyses detail some of the expected benefits and costs if the Hyatt Avenue truck stop site in Newark is developed. The results are summarized as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Besides construction and annual maintenance costs, a proposed truck stop at this location is expected to generate $5,546,838 in total taxes annually and reduce greenhouse gases.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, concentrating so many trucks in any one location increases noise and sound pollution in and around the area, potentially resulting in a 13% to over 14% reduction in nearby residential property values.</li>
            <li>While not yet monetized however, the safety benefits associated with the site are perhaps most significant and can hopefully be monetized in future studies in order to fully outline both the costs and benefits of this or any site.</li>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>As the case study finds, certain factors of a truck stop development or expansion are more impactful to society than others. For example, sales tax proves to be the most lucrative source of revenue to the state government. On the other hand, society appears to directly be affected by noise pollution to a much greater extent than air pollution by means of significantly larger reductions in residential property values. Moving forward however, future studies may choose to assign greater weight to one or more of these consequences over others.</p>
